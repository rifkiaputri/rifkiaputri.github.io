## About Me

Hi! I am a lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science and Electronics (DCSE)](https://dcse.fmipa.ugm.ac.id/) at Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the [Users & Information lab, KAIST](https://uilab.kr/) advised by [Alice Oh](https://aliceoh9.github.io/).

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in question answering and underrepresented languages. I am passionate about developing NLP technologies that bridge the gap between high and underrepresented languages, making AI more inclusive and accessible to diverse communities.
